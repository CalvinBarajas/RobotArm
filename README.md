Dynamixel AX-12A Robotic Arm

COMPONENTS:

Raspberry Pi 3B (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3055?src=raspberrypi).

Dynamixel AX-12A (Four) When you purchase the Dynamixel AX-12A motors, they come with a whole bunch of tiny bolts, nuts, plastic washer, etc (https://www.trossenrobotics.com/dynamixel-ax-12-robot-actuator.aspx). You will also need some longer longer bolts to connect the Bioloid Frame F10 to Bioloid Frame F8. I went to my hardware store and purchased the following:

Ten (10): 1-72 x 1/2 Flat Head Phillips ($0.25 x 10)
Ten (10): 1-72 Finished Hex Nut ($0.28 x 10)

You can get these online if you can purchase just 10 of each. Here's an example of a vendor (I have not used them):
